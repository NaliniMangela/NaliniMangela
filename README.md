Hi, my name is Nalini Mangela, and I am a Registered Nurse with a Bachelor of Science in Nursing.
 I have experience working in various departments such as emergency, intensive care, medical surgical, and Covid intensive units. 
I like a challenging opportunity to work part-time as a registered nurse with an organization to enhance my knowledge, personality, skills, and techniques by having exposure to the working environment with assured loyalty and dedication.
